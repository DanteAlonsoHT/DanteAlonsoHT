<h1> Hi Everyone, I'm Dante Alonso! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/o0vwzuFwCGAFO/giphy.gif" width="70"></h1>

_I’m currently working on web development projects with HTML / CSS / Javascript and recently with Bootstrap as a student in Microverse, and also for machine learning applications using Python._

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web development, front-end and back-end, computer vision, and trying to solve social issues in my local environment :)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and teaching improvement ideas for everyone.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with back-end knowledge and experience.
- 💬 Ask me about computer vision concerns or to collaborate in projects.
